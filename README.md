# Karel-Implementation

The question this code responds to is one asking for classes representing a game board, Karel, and SuperKarel. Karel can move, 
turn left, put a beeper down, and pick a beeper up. SuperKarel can move, turn left, put a beeper down, pick a beeper up, turn 
right, and repeat a command a number of times. Karel and SuperKarel can also load and store board states using readBoard(filename) 
and writeBoard(filename).
